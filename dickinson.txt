SUCCESS is counted sweetest
By those who ne'er succeed.
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need.

Not one of all the purple host
Who took the flag to-day
Can tell the definition,
So clear, of victory,

As he, defeated, dying,
On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph
Break, agonized and clear.

OUR share of night to bear,
Our share of morning,
Our blank in bliss to fill,
Our blank in scorning.

Here a star, and there a star,
Some lose their way.
Here a mist, and there a mist,
Afterwards—day!

Soul, wilt thou toss again ?
By just such a hazard
Hundreds have lost, indeed,
But tens have won an all.

Angels' breathless ballot
Lingers to record thee ;
Imps in eager caucus
Raffle for my soul.

'T is so much joy !  'T is so much joy !
If I should fail, what poverty !
And yet, as poor as I
Have ventured upon a throw ;
Have gained!  Yes !  Hesitated so
This side the victory !

Life is but life, and death but death !
Bliss is but bliss and breath but breath !
And if, indeed, I fail,
At least to know the worst is sweet.
Defeat means nothing but defeat,
No drearier can prevail !

And if I gain, — oh, gun at sea,
Oh, bells that in the steeples be,
At first repeat it slow !
For heaven is a different thing
Conjectured, and waked sudden in,
And might o'erwhelm me so !

Glee ! the great storm is over !
Four have recovered the land ;
Forty gone down together
Into the boiling sand.

Ring, for the scant salvation !
Toll, for the bonnie souls, —
Neighbor and friend and bridegroom,
Spinning upon the shoals !

How they will tell the shipwreck
When winter shakes the door,
Till the children ask, "But the forty ?
Did they come back no more ?"

Then a silence suffuses the story,
And a softness the teller's eye ;
And the children no further question,
And only the waves reply.

If I can stop one heart from breaking,
I shall not live in vain ;
If I can ease one life the aching,
Or cool one pain,
Or help one fainting robin
Unto his nest again,
I shall not live in vain.

Within my reach !
I could have touched !
I might have chanced that way !
Soft sauntered through the village,
Sauntered as soft away !
So unsuspected violets
Within the fields lie low ;
Too late for striving fingers
That passed, an hour ago.

A wounded deer leaps highest,
I've heard the hunter tell ;
'T is but the ecstasy of death,
And then the brake is still.

The smitten rock that gushes,
The trampled steel that springs :
A cheek is always redder
Just where the hectic stings !

Mirth is the mail of anguish,
In which it cautions arm,
Lest anybody spy the blood
And "You're hurt" exclaim !

The heart asks pleasure first,
And then, excuse from pain ;
And then, those little anodynes
That deaden suffering ;

And then, to go to sleep ;
And then, if it should be
The will of its Inquisitor,
The liberty to die.

A PRECIOUS, mouldering pleasure 't is
To meet an antique book,
In just the dress his century wore ;
A privilege, I think,

His venerable hand to take,
And warming in our own,
A passage back, or two, to make
To times when he was young.

His quaint opinions to inspect,
His knowledge to unfold
On what concerns our mutual mind,
The literature of old;

What interested scholars most,
What competitions ran
When Plato was a certainty,
And Sophocles a man;

When Sappho was a living girl,
And Beatrice wore
The gown that Dante deified.
Facts, centuries before,

He traverses familiar,
As one should come to town
And tell you all your dreams were true:
He lived where dreams were sown.

His presence is enchantment,
You beg him not to go;
Old volumes shake their vellum heads
And tantalize, just so.
